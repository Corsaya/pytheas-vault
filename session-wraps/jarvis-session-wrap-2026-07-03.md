# Jarvis Session Wrap — 2026-07-03

**v1 is code-complete and live-verified.** All three items proposed this
session were approved and implemented the same day. Suite: **109/109**
(jarvis) + **10/10** (ccdash).

## Built this session

| What | Where | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| CLI (last v1 component) | `jarvis/cli.py`, 21 tests | DEC-020 — failed call records nothing (user-confirmed); diagram left as-is (user pick); did-you-mean note on typo'd tiers; unknown commands never burn a model call; per-turn memory reload |
| Spend log write-through | in cli.py, `~/.local/state/jarvis/usage.jsonl` | DEC-021 — one JSON line per turn; CLI writes it, tracker untouched; best-effort |
| Self-improvement | `jarvis/improve.py`, 13 tests | DEC-022 — `jarvis improve "<request>"` → read-only `claude -p` agent (`--tools "Read,Grep,Glob"`) emits diff+rationale to `proposals/` (gitignored); `--apply` refuses protected paths & dirty tracked files, branches, `git apply`, runs tests, never commits |
| Live spend dashboard | `ccdash --watch` (`~/code/usage-monitor`), 5 tests | tails the DEC-021 log, 2s ANSI redraw, stdlib-only |

Also: console script `jarvis` in pyproject; `__init__.py` exports; two new
CLAUDE.md gotchas; README watch section in ccdash.

## Verified live (not just unit-tested)

- **First end-to-end smoke test passed** on `/model fast`: real haiku reply,
  correct model label, accurate `/usage`, exit 0. Spend log wrote 1 correct line;
  `ccdash --watch` renders it.
- **`--no-session-persistence` keeps Jarvis's calls OUT of `~/.claude/projects`**
  (no project dir created, smoke text in no log) — so the DEC-021 spend log is
  the *only* live view of Jarvis usage. ccdash cannot see it otherwise.
- Binary is now **2.1.200** (fixtures are 2.1.198 snapshots); client parsed fine.
- `--tools "Read,Grep,Glob"` runs headless, zero permission prompts — the
  improve propose-phase mechanism is verified at the invocation level.

## Not yet done

- **First real `jarvis improve` propose run** — spends full-tier (Fable 5)
  tokens; you fire it. Mechanics are unit-tested + invocation-verified.
- **Nothing is committed.** The entire implementation (July 1 + July 3, DEC-014
  → DEC-022) sits uncommitted on `main` (only the 2 scaffold commits exist).
  Committing is the obvious next housekeeping step — and `improve --apply`
  *requires* a clean tracked tree, so it stays unusable until this happens.
- `memory/identity.md` still blank (owner task).
- api-mode `LLMClient` — the "pay for exactly what I use" path (DEC-011 seam).
  Not scheduled; see note below.

## Next session

1. Commit the work (suggest one commit per component/DEC, or one v1 squash).
2. You run a real `jarvis improve` end-to-end.
3. Then per the master plan: daily-news/weekly-survey component (DEC-013),
   with ccdash `--brief` as its usage line.

Source of truth: `~/code/jarvis/DECISIONS.md` DEC-020 → DEC-022.
